### Biography

Lukas Schmid is currently a research scientist at the MIT SPARK Lab lead by Prof. Luca Carlone at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Before that, he was a postdoctoral fellow at MIT SPARK and briefly a postdoctoral researcher at the Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) lead by Prof. Roland Siegwart at ETH Zürich. He earned his PhD in 2022 from ETH Zürich, advised by Prof. Roland Siegwart, Dr. Cesar Cadena, and Dr. Juan Nieto, where he also obtained his M.Sc. in Robotics, Systems, and Control (RSC) in 2019. During his PhD, he was a visiting researcher at the Microsoft Mixed Reality and AI Lab lead by Prof. Marc Pollefeys.

His work has been recognized with several awards and honors, including the Outstanding Systems Paper Award at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS), the ETH Medal for outstanding PhD theses, the ETH Medal for outstanding master theses, the Willi Studer Prize for the best graduate of the year at ETH, the first place in the 2024 Hilti SLAM challenge, and a Swiss National Science Foundation postdoc-mobility fellowship.

His main research interests is in autonomy for intelligent mobile systems, where he focuses on active and passive 3D perception and understanding of complex, dynamic, and changing environments for robotic interaction and augmented reality. This includes research on dense geometric and semantic scene representations, scene abstraction and understanding, as well as detection and prediction of moving and changing entities. He complements this with research on lifelong learning and mapping, as well as active path planning to build these representations autonomously in unknown environments and enable continuous improvement of a robot's scene model and perception capabilities. While his work is grounded in rigorous theory, his methods are demonstrated on-board fully autonomous mobile robots and drones in complex real-world scenarios.
