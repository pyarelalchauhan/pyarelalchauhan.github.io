# Teaching

I'm passionate about the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers.  
Next to teaching lectures and exercise classes, I strongly contribute to this through the supervision of Master, Semester, and Bachelor Theses, or other research projects.

## Student Projects

I have supervised over **45 students** in individual projects and theses.  
I regularly upload project proposals and also accept proactive applications of highly motivated students.  

If you are interested in working on a project in the fields of **robotic scene understanding, active perception, or long-term and continual learning**, please send a short CV and transcript to **lschmid@mit.edu**.  
Please ensure that you are accepted/eligible for an MIT project first.
